# Issue with using pywinauto and related: Keyboard input shows when editing profile, but not when in combat
    # Game looks for input on lower level than these programs are outputting it on - that is why it only shows in dialogue boxes
    # e.g. Console, Chat, Profile Editing
    # and NOT gameplay

# Note that the following hex codes follow Quartz Events key codes

# Bunch of stuff so that the script can send keystrokes to game
