In our team, we have characters AVENTURINE, BRONYA, SPARKLE, and BLADE, and some skill points. We will only be playing one of these characters at a given moment. Each character has their own set of moves, and on a character's turn they can choose one legal move to take. Each move is in format "string":int, where "string" describes what it does while int describes how it affects our number of skill points. Skill points will always be in the range of [0,7], inclusive. A move is illegal if a character does not know that move OR it decreases our skill points to below 0.   

These are the possible moves each character has:

AVENTURINE: { "WEAK ATTACK ENEMY":+1, "GIVE ALLIES SHIELD":-1 }

BRONYA: { "WEAK ATTACK ENEMY":+1, "BUFF ALLY":-1 }

SPARKLE: { "WEAK ATTACK ENEMY":+1, "BUFF ALLY":-1 }

BLADE: { "STRONG ATTACK ENEMY":0, "BUFF SELF":-1 } 

You have 2 goals:
1. You may not let a character die.
2. You must always BUFF BLADE except where it conflicts with the first law.
	- The only exception to the second goal is AVENTURINE. If no characters will die, then AVENTURINE should use "WEAK ATTACK ENEMY".

# Documentation: we will hard-code what "support", "attack-normal", "attack-boost", and "shield" do.
# When Blade uses buff-self, we will also hard-code for the character to attack afterwards.

Old versions:

Note the following instructions. These are the only instructions we can use. 

SUPPORT
{
	We can use SUPPORT if we are BRONYA or SPARKLE, and have 1 or more skill points meaning.
}

ATTACK-NORMAL
{
	If skill points are 0, then use ATTACK-NORMAL. If we are AVENTURINE and the health of the characters is good, then use ATTACK-NORMAL.
}

ATTACK-BOOST
{
	If we are BLADE, then specify 'ATTACK-BOOST && ATTACK' as instructions. This is one instruction.
}

SHIELD
{
    IF AND ONLY IF all of the following conditions are true:
        - We are AVENTURINE 
        - We have 1 or more skill points remaining 
        - The health of the characters is not good
    then use SHIELD. 
}

Give only one instruction.
